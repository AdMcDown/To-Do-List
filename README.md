A To Do List website which allows user to add items to there list, check them off and delete them.
 
 Features:
  - Drag and drop common items from side panels
  - login to Facebook (currently disabled due to limited allowed API usage)
  - nice sounds when checking items off or uncheck (if you didnt mean to check them off) and when deleting an item of the list

All coding done by Adam McNown! I hope you enjoy my to do list website!
